## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea
1.Simulate Boardroom Interviews – Create an interactive panel for candidates.
2.Ensure Question Relevance – AI will assess the suitability of questions based on the candidate's expertise.
3.Evaluate Candidate Responses – NLP-based analysis for response quality and relevancy.
4.Generate a Suitability Score – Aggregate scores based on question relevance and response evaluation.
5.Automated Question Pool: AI dynamically generates technical and managerial questions based on job roles.
6.Expert-Verified Questions: AI suggests questions, but human experts can validate or modify them.
7.Custom Difficulty Levels: Questions can be categorized as Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, adjusting dynamically based on candidate performance.
8.Real-Time Feedback: Candidates get automated feedback on weak areas after the interview.
9.Leaderboard for Candidates: Ranks candidates based on performance for competitive positions.
